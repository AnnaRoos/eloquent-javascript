# eloquent-javascript
Going through the exercises in "Eloquent Javascript" by Marijn Haverbeke. Trying to solve them on my own, (and not googling the problem, only subproblems if needed), then comparing them with the solutions in the book. 

All code written in Node. I'm testing the solutions with Jest.
