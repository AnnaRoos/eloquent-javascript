# eloquent-javascript
Going through the exercises in ["Eloquent Javascript"](https://eloquentjavascript.net/index.html) by Marijn Haverbeke. Trying to solve them on my own, not looking at the hints or googling the problem, (only syntax if needed), then comparing my code with the solutions in the book. 

Exercises in chapters 2-12 are written in Node and tested with Jest.
