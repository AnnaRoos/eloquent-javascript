# eloquent-javascript
Going through the exercises in "Eloquent Javascript" by Marijn Haverbeke. Trying to solve them on my own, (and not googling the problem, only subproblems if needed), then comparing my code with the solutions in the book. 

Exercises in chapters 2-12 is written in Node and tested with Jest.
